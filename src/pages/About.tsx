        Sarina DiLuca is the chef and storyteller behind Sarina's Kitchen. She grew up rolling pasta

        kitchens across Ontario.

      <p className={styles.lead}>

      <p>
        Sarina believes every memorable meal begins with intention. After culinary school and years
        spent on the line in Toronto's restaurant scene, she launched Sarina's Kitchen to bring
        restaurant polish to at-home dining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today she pairs seasonal ingredients with Italian roots, championing local farmers and
        teaching guests why the best dishes start with good company.
